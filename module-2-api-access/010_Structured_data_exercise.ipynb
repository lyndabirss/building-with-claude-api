    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- Message prefilling can include full sentences, not just delimiters like ```\n",
    "- Prefill can set instructions: \"Here are all three commands without comments\"\n",
    "- Combine natural language prefilling with stop sequences for clean output\n",
    "- Useful for getting multiple items in single response without explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise Goal\n",
    "Generate three AWS CLI commands with no comments or explanations using only message prefilling and stop sequences"
