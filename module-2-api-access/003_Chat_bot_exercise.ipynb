    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- Combines API requests with multi-turn conversation management\n",
    "- Conversational loop: get user input → send to Claude → display response → repeat\n",
    "- Exit conditions allow user to end the conversation gracefully\n",
    "- Message history persists throughout the session\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Code Patterns\n",
    "- `while True:` loop for continuous conversation\n",
    "- `input()` to capture user messages\n",
    "- Check for exit commands (e.g., \"quit\", \"exit\", \"bye\")\n",
    "- `messages.append()` to build conversation history\n",
    "- Display both user and assistant messages for context\n",
    "- Handle errors gracefully (API failures, connection issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Skills\n",
    "- Building interactive CLI applications\n",
    "- Managing stateful conversations\n",
    "- User input validation\n",
    "- Creating conversational AI interfaces"
