    "# System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- System prompts customize HOW Claude responds, not WHAT it responds to\n",
    "- Assigns Claude a specific role or behavior pattern (e.g., \"You are a patient math tutor\")\n",
    "- Controls tone, style, and approach to answering\n",
    "- System prompt is separate from the messages array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Code Patterns\n",
    "- Pass system prompt as `system` parameter: `client.messages.create(system=\"You are...\", ...)`\n",
    "- System prompt = plain string, not a message object\n",
    "- Structure: assign role first, then provide behavioral instructions\n",
    "- Handle optional system prompts with conditional parameter passing\n",
    "- Use `**params` unpacking for flexible function arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "- Keep system prompts clear and specific\n",
    "- Focus on behavior/tone, not content instructions\n",
    "- First line typically assigns the role\n",
    "- Follow with specific guidelines for how to respond"
