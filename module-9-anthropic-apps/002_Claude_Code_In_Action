# Claude Code in Action

## NOTE: Reference in conjunction with app_starter

 Key Commands
* `/init` - Scans codebase, creates CLAUDE.md documentation
* `#` - Quick add notes to CLAUDE.md (e.g., `# Always use descriptive variable names`)
* `/clear` - Clears conversation history and resets context

## CLAUDE.md Scopes
* **Project** - Shared between all engineers (checked into git)
* **Local** - Personal notes (not in git)
* **User** - Used across all your projects

## Effective Workflow (3 Steps)
1. **Feed Context** - Ask Claude to read relevant files first
2. **Plan Solution** - Ask Claude to plan approach (NO code yet)
3. **Implement** - Ask Claude to implement the plan

## Test-Driven Development Workflow
1. Feed context into Claude
2. Ask Claude to think of test cases
3. Ask Claude to implement tests
4. Ask Claude to write code that passes tests

## Practical Example
```bash
# Step 1: Context
> Read the math.py and document.py files

# Step 2: Planning
> Plan to implement document_path_to_markdown tool:
1. Create function with file path parameter
2. Validate file exists
3. Determine file type from extension
4. Read binary data
5. Leverage existing functions
6. Return markdown string

# Step 3: Implementation
> Implement the plan
```

## Key Principle
Claude Code = collaborative partner, not just code generator
More context + structure = better results
