    "reasoning": "The solution meets all three mandatory requirements with strong execution on format and content. The meal plan is well-structured with exact portions, timings, and clear macronutrient tracking. However, the truncated Dinner section is a critical flaw that prevents full verification of daily totals. The calorie surplus recommendation criterion is partially met (the surplus exists but lacks explicit justification). Protein distribution mostly aligns with the 25-40g per meal guideline across 4+ meals, though Snack #2 falls short. The incomplete final entry prevents a higher score despite otherwise excellent work."

    "reasoning": "The solution demonstrates strong understanding of marathon nutrition principles and meets all mandatory requirements in structure and intent. It provides daily caloric total, complete macronutrient breakdown, and detailed meals with portions and timing across 5 eating occasions. The carbohydrate loading strategy (60%) is well-executed and appropriate. However, the incomplete Dinner section is a critical flaw - the table cuts off without showing the final calorie count for that meal, making it impossible to verify the claimed 3,200 kcal daily total or confirm the exact macronutrient percentages. While this appears to be a formatting/transcription error rather than a conceptual problem, it technically violates the requirement to include a 'daily calorific total' that can be verified. The caloric intake is also slightly conservative for optimal endurance training. Despite these issues, the core content quality is high and the solution would function well if completed."

While the partial data shown is high-quality, the incomplete delivery is a critical flaw that undermines the core deliverable of a '1-day meal plan.' The solution meets 2 of 3 mandatory requirements (daily calorific total is stated but unverified due to incompleteness; macronutrient breakdown is partially shown; meals with timing and portions are partially shown)."
